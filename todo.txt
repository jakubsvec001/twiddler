Bare Minimum Requirements

--- Show the user new tweets somehow. (You can show them automatically as they're created, or create a button that displays new tweets.)
--- Display the timestamps of when the tweets were created. This timestamp should reflect the actual time the tweets were created, and should not just be hardcoded.
--- Design your interface so that you want to look at and use the product you're making.
--- Allow the user to click on a username to see that user's timeline.
Advanced

--- Show when the tweets were created in a human-friendly way (eg "10 minutes ago"). You'll want to find and use a library for this.
--- Allow the user to tweet. (This is going to require you to understand a little more about data_generator.js, but you shouldn't need to modify anything.)
